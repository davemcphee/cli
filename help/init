Usage: boat init <project-id>

Create a new directory, with initial project files. This is usually only done
once and when the project is initially created.

Afterwards we *highly* recommend that you push the git repository to a git
service of your choice and add the git repository url to the project.

New members of the team can then easily git clone the repository and get a
flying start.
